## About Resource Scheduler

Resource Scheduler is a Laravel application built by the David O. McKay Library at BYU-Idaho. It is currently undergoing development and is not ready to use in production. 

The goal is to make it flexible enough to be used to schedule any type of resource - study rooms, equipment, etc.; however, our use case will be focused on scheduling 3D printers or printing services distributed around campus.
