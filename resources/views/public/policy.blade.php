            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                The McKay Library desires to offer the BYU-Idaho community access to emerging technologies such as 3D printers to inspire interest in design and help students bring their creations to life. This policy establishes how and under what circumstances the BYU-Idaho community may use the Library’s 3D printer.
            </p>

            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
                The price to print your 3D model can vary depending on several factors such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The printer you choose to use. Each Department can set it's own pricing model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The type of filament you choose. Each filament is priced according to th ebase cost. Some printers can print dozens of materials and the price for each of those varies greatly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The size of your printed model. Because the cost is usually directly affected by the amount of filament used, a larger model will cost more than a scaled down version of the same model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The mount of time it takes to print. Depending on the pricing structure of the department, you may be charged addition fees for each hours or a surcharge every {X} hours of printing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                After telling us a little bit about your model and selecting a filament, we can tell you how much it will cost to print.
            </p>
